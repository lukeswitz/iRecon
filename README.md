## Configuration

### Tool Paths (Edit script directly)
```python
TOOL_PATHS = {
    'nmap': '/usr/bin/nmap',
    'cme': '/usr/bin/crackmapexec',
    'gobuster': '/usr/bin/gobuster',
    'feroxbuster': '/usr/bin/feroxbuster',
    'impacket': '/opt/impacket/examples/'
}
```

### Service Checks
Modify `SERVICE_CHECKS` dictionary to:
- Add new service checks
- Customize enumeration commands
- Adjust timeouts (default: 30s)

## FAQ

**Q: Tools not found?**  
A: Verify paths in `TOOL_PATHS` and install missing packages

**Q: Scan taking too long?**  
A: Adjust `timeout` in `run_cmd()` or reduce thread count

**Q: Report not generating?**  
A: Check write permissions and HTML escaping

**Q: Commands failing?**  
A: Ensure all dependencies are installed and in PATH

## Disclaimer

‚ö†Ô∏è **Use Responsibly**  
This tool should only be used on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal.

```bash
# Legal Notice
echo "By using CyberScan, you agree to use it only for lawful purposes"
```

# iRecon

iRecon is an automated Nmap-based reconnaissance script designed to speed up the initial enumeration phase during CTFs or real-world pentests. It's especially useful for platforms like Hack The Box, where time and efficiency are key.

## Installation
Prerequisites
```bash
sudo apt install nmap xsltproc python3 wget bat firefox-esr lolcat xclip -y
```
Installing the tool
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gzzcoo/iRecon/refs/heads/main/iRecon
chmod +x iRecon
sudo mv iRecon /usr/local/bin/iRecon
```

## Usage
```bash
iRecon <IP>
```

## üöÄ Features

  - Performs a full port scan (-p-) using Nmap to detect open ports.

  - Automatically extracts open ports and copies them to your clipboard.

  - Detects service versions and runs basic reconnaissance scripts (-sCV) on discovered ports.

  - Generates a full Nmap XML report, transforms it into HTML, and opens it in your browser automatically.

  - Temporarily hosts the report using Python's HTTP server and releases the port right after.

  - Clean, quiet execution with colored terminal output (if added to your .zshrc or bash script).

## üìå Why use iRecon?

While iRecon runs in the background automating tedious steps, you can focus on exploring services, web apps, or other vectors in parallel. This workflow dramatically reduces downtime and boosts productivity during reconnaissance.
No more wasting time typing repetitive Nmap commands or organizing reports manually ‚Äî iRecon takes care of it all, and your port 6969 stays clean and free afterward üòâ

## üõ†Ô∏è Perfect For

  - Hack The Box

  - TryHackMe

  - Offensive Security Labs

  - Red Team internal recon

  - Any scenario where speed and output clarity matter
